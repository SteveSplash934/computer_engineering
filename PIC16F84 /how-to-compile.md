Apologies for the confusion earlier! If you're using **NASM**, **GCC**, and **VS Code** to generate a `.hex` file for a **PIC microcontroller simulation**, it's not natively supported by these tools. NASM and GCC are for x86 assembly and C/C++ programming, while PIC microcontrollers use a different architecture.

However, you can create a workaround or use additional tools to get your `.hex` file. Here’s an alternative process tailored to your setup:

---

### 1. **Understand the Workflow**
   - **NASM** and **GCC** won't generate `.hex` files directly for a PIC microcontroller.
   - You’ll need to either:
     - Use a PIC assembler (like MPASM or MPLAB), or
     - Use a generic assembler and convert its binary output to HEX format.

---

### 2. **Option 1: Use a Binary-to-HEX Converter**
   1. Write your assembly code as usual in NASM.
   2. Compile the code to a binary file:
      ```bash
      nasm -f bin -o program.bin program.asm
      ```
   3. Convert the binary to HEX using a tool like `srec_cat` (part of the **SRecord** tools suite):
      ```bash
      srec_cat program.bin -binary -offset 0x0000 -o program.hex -Intel
      ```
   - Install **SRecord**: [SRecord Download](http://srecord.sourceforge.net/).

### 3. **Option 2: Write for PIC Architecture**
   Since NASM and GCC aren’t meant for PIC programming, you can use these tools only if you're targeting x86. For PIC microcontrollers, here's how you can use **VS Code** with MPLAB-like tools:

   1. **Install MPLAB XC8 (Preferred for PIC)**:
      - If you're simulating for a PIC microcontroller, install MPLAB XC8.
   2. **Write PIC Assembly Code in VS Code**:
      - Configure VS Code for PIC assembly by writing a `.asm` file and using MPLAB XC8 assembler commands.

---

### 4. **Option 3: Simulate an x86 Circuit Instead**
   If you want to keep using NASM and GCC for a similar x86 simulation:
   - Write an x86-compatible assembly program.
   - Simulate it with an emulator like **EMU8086** or run it directly on your PC.
   - Proteus doesn't directly support x86 simulations, but you can integrate it with external processes.
