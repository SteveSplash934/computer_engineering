## Mapping Techniques

Mapping techniques in computer engineering determine how memory blocks or data are assigned to storage locations like cache, main memory, or devices. Understanding these techniques is critical for optimizing performance, especially in memory hierarchies (e.g., cache and RAM). Here's a breakdown of the main **mapping techniques**:

---

## **1. Cache Mapping Techniques**

Cache mapping is crucial for determining how blocks of data from the main memory are stored in the cache.

### a. **Direct Mapping**

- **Concept**: Each block of main memory maps to exactly one cache line.
- **Implementation**:
  - A memory block's address is divided into:
    1. **Tag**: Identifies the memory block.
    2. **Index**: Specifies the cache line where the block is stored.
    3. **Block Offset**: Determines the specific word within the block.
- **Advantages**:
  - Simple and easy to implement.
  - Fast lookup for a specific address.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - High collision rate: If two blocks map to the same cache line, one is evicted.
- **Example**:
  ```
  Cache Lines: 4
  Memory Blocks: 16
  Block 0 → Line 0, Block 4 → Line 0, Block 8 → Line 0...
  ```

### b. **Fully Associative Mapping**

- **Concept**: Any memory block can be placed in any cache line.
- **Implementation**:
  - A memory block's address consists of:
    1. **Tag**: Used for comparisons during lookup.
    2. **Block Offset**: Specifies the word within the block.
- **Advantages**:
  - Eliminates collision problems since any block can go anywhere.
  - Best utilization of cache space.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - More complex hardware for searching all cache lines.
  - Slower lookup compared to direct mapping.
- **Example**:
  ```
  Cache Lines: 4
  Memory Blocks: 16
  Any block can occupy any of the 4 cache lines.
  ```

### c. **Set-Associative Mapping**

- **Concept**: A compromise between direct and fully associative mapping.
  - Cache is divided into sets, and each set contains multiple lines.
  - A memory block maps to a specific set but can occupy any line within the set.
- **Implementation**:
  - A memory block's address is divided into:
    1. **Tag**: Identifies the memory block.
    2. **Set Index**: Specifies the set where the block maps.
    3. **Block Offset**: Specifies the word within the block.
- **Advantages**:
  - Reduces collisions compared to direct mapping.
  - Faster lookup than fully associative mapping.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Slightly more complex than direct mapping.
- **Example**:
  ```
  Cache Lines: 4 (2 sets, 2 lines per set)
  Memory Blocks: 16
  Block 0 → Set 0, Block 8 → Set 0, Block 1 → Set 1...
  ```

## **2. Virtual Memory Mapping**

Virtual memory uses a mapping technique to translate virtual addresses (used by applications) into physical addresses (used by hardware).

### a. **Paging**

- **Concept**: Divides memory into fixed-size blocks called _pages_ (virtual memory) and _frames_ (physical memory).
- **Implementation**:
  - Virtual address is divided into:
    1. **Page Number**: Index in the page table.
    2. **Page Offset**: The specific address within the page.
  - The page table maps virtual pages to physical frames.
- **Advantages**:
  - No external fragmentation.
  - Easy to swap pages between disk and RAM.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Internal fragmentation if pages aren't fully used.
  - Extra memory overhead for page tables.

### b. **Segmentation**

- **Concept**: Divides memory into variable-sized segments based on logical divisions (e.g., code, data, stack).
- **Implementation**:
  - Virtual address is divided into:
    1. **Segment Number**: Index in the segment table.
    2. **Segment Offset**: Address within the segment.
- **Advantages**:
  - Logical division of memory.
  - Supports dynamic memory allocation.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - May cause external fragmentation.

---

## **3. Memory-Mapped I/O**

- **Concept**: Maps device registers to specific memory addresses so devices can be accessed as if they were memory locations.
- **Implementation**:
  - Specific address ranges in the memory map are reserved for hardware devices.
  - CPU instructions for memory access (e.g., `LOAD` and `STORE`) interact with device registers.
- **Advantages**:
  - Unified addressing mechanism simplifies design.
  - Faster access to device data.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Consumes address space that could otherwise be used for RAM.

---

## **4. GPU Memory Mapping**

Modern GPUs use memory mapping to manage communication between the CPU and GPU.

- **Unified Memory**: A single memory space shared between CPU and GPU, simplifying programming.
- **Direct Memory Access (DMA)**: Transfers data directly between memory and the GPU, bypassing the CPU for efficiency.

| **Mapping Technique**     | **Collision Handling** | **Speed** | **Hardware Complexity** |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| Direct Mapping            | High                   | Fast      | Low                     |
| Fully Associative Mapping | None                   | Moderate  | High                    |
| Set-Associative Mapping   | Moderate               | Moderate  | Moderate                |

Yes, memory mapping techniques often involve calculations, especially when determining memory addresses, cache placement, or virtual-to-physical address translations. Here are some common calculations involved:

---

### **1. Cache Mapping Calculations**

#### a. **Direct Mapping**

- **Formula to Find Cache Line Index**:
  \[
  \text{Index} = (\text{Memory Address} \mod \text{Number of Cache Lines})
  \]
- **Tag Calculation**:
  \[
  \text{Tag} = \text{Memory Address} \div (\text{Cache Line Size} \times \text{Number of Cache Lines})
  \]
- Example:
  - Memory Address: 0x1A3 (419 in decimal)
  - Cache Size: 64 lines, each of 16 bytes
  - **Index**:
    \[
    419 \mod 64 = 35
    \]
  - **Tag**:
    \[
    419 \div (16 \times 64) = \text{Tag is the higher-order bits.}
    \]

#### b. **Set-Associative Mapping**

- **Set Index Calculation**:
  \[
  \text{Set Index} = (\text{Memory Address} \mod \text{Number of Sets})
  \]
- **Tag Calculation**:
  \[
  \text{Tag} = \text{Memory Address} \div (\text{Number of Sets} \times \text{Block Size})
  \]
- Example:
  - Cache: 4 sets, 2 lines per set, Block Size: 16 bytes
  - Address: 0x5A2
  - **Set Index**:
    \[
    0x5A2 \mod 4 = 2
    \]
  - **Tag**:
    \[
    0x5A2 \div (4 \times 16)
    \]

#### c. **Fully Associative Mapping**

- Only the **Tag** is stored since a block can be placed in any cache line.
- **Tag Calculation**:
  \[
  \text{Tag} = \text{Memory Address} \div \text{Block Size}
  \]

---

### **2. Paging Calculations**

- Virtual memory uses page tables to map virtual addresses to physical frames.

#### a. **Page Number and Offset**

- Virtual Address is divided into:
  \[
  \text{Virtual Address} = (\text{Page Number}, \text{Page Offset})
  \]
- **Page Number Calculation**:
  \[
  \text{Page Number} = \text{Virtual Address} \div \text{Page Size}
  \]
- **Offset Calculation**:
  \[
  \text{Offset} = \text{Virtual Address} \mod \text{Page Size}
  \]

#### b. **Physical Address Translation**

- Translate virtual address to physical address:
  \[
  \text{Physical Address} = (\text{Frame Number} \times \text{Page Size}) + \text{Offset}
  \]

#### Example:

- Virtual Address: 0x1234 (4660 in decimal)
- Page Size: 1024 bytes
- **Page Number**:
  \[
  4660 \div 1024 = 4
  \]
- **Offset**:
  \[
  4660 \mod 1024 = 516
  \]
- If Frame Number = 10, **Physical Address**:
  \[
  (10 \times 1024) + 516 = 10756
  \]

### **3. Memory-Mapped I/O Calculations**

In memory-mapped I/O, addresses are predefined in a memory map. There are no direct mathematical calculations involved, but designers must ensure address ranges don’t overlap with main memory.

---

### **4. GPU Memory Calculations**

- **Unified Memory Offsets**:
  When mapping GPU memory, offsets are calculated for assigning portions of memory for the GPU and CPU.
